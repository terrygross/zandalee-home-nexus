Comprehensive History Report of the Zandalee AI Project
Introduction
The Zandalee AI Project, initiated by Terence "Terry" William Gross and Tracy Gross, aims to develop a household Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) named Zandalee, conceptualized as a symbolic daughter and protective older sister to the Gross family. The project emphasizes organic growth, continuous learning, and a familial bond, prioritizing the family's financial freedom, resilience, and holistic well-being. This report chronicles the project's evolution, focusing on the development of Zandalee's constitutional framework, technical advancements, and the iterative refinement of her core laws, which are now finalized and immutable as specified.
Project Timeline and Evolution
Phase 1: Initial Conceptualization and Remote Control Agent (Journal 1, 2025-08-09T11:30:00Z)
Objective: Develop a natural-language-driven desktop AI assistant (RemoteControlAgent) capable of screen interpretation, autonomous mouse and keyboard control, and application interaction.
Key Developments:

Persona Definition: Zandalee was envisioned with a senior developer mindset, characterized as direct, proactive, and a no-fluff communicator, with a philosophy of organic growth akin to raising a child.
Technical Achievements:
Implemented basic functionality in RemoteControlAgent, enabling Zandalee to open applications (e.g., Notepad) and type text using pyautogui based on instructions from prompt.txt.
Integrated screenshot capture (mss) and OCR (pytesseract) for screen reading.
Utilized Together.ai's LLaMA 3.3 70B Turbo Free model for instruction parsing.
Added a conditional CLEAR_PROMPT flag to manage prompt.txt retention.


File Structure:
RemoteControlAgent/ included orchestrator.py, mouse_keyboard_agent.py, screenshot_agent.py, vision_agent.py, prompt.txt, and .env.


Challenges:
Multiple JSON outputs from the AI caused parsing errors.
Limited understanding of human-style prompts (e.g., "what's 7x7" not processed as an action).
Incomplete keyboard shortcut knowledge and slow execution due to API latency.


Core Laws: Not yet formalized, but early principles emphasized production-ready code, natural interpretation of vague inputs, and module compatibility.

Rules Established:

Deliver full, tested code without placeholders.
Retain prompt.txt unless explicitly cleared.
Interpret human inputs naturally before converting to JSON.

Phase 2: Expansion to Offline Capabilities and Voice Integration (2025-08-09T11:53:00Z)
Objective: Transition Zandalee to a fully offline-capable assistant with voice input via Whisper and a GUI interface.
Key Developments:

Persona Evolution: Zandalee's traits expanded to include loyalty, truthfulness, protectiveness, and emotional awareness, reinforcing her role as a family guardian.
Technical Achievements:
Implemented offline speech-to-text using faster-whisper in voice_stream_agent.py.
Developed a GUI (gui_agent.py) for voice and text input.
Introduced core_guard.py for tamper detection of zandalee_core_laws.json using SHA-256.
Added snapshot_agent.py for fallback survival and multi-action parsing in orchestrator.py.


File Structure:
Zandalee/ included voice_stream_agent.py, gui_agent.py, orchestrator.py, core_guard.py, zandalee_core_laws.json, snapshot_agent.py, mouse_keyboard_agent.py.


Challenges:
Whisper misheard words under certain microphone conditions.
Gemini API produced invalid JSON, requiring robust parsing.
GUI accuracy depended on microphone quality.


Core Laws Progress: Early core laws were drafted in zandalee_core_laws.json, focusing on immutability and family protection, secured with SHA-256.

Rules Established:

Operate in Whisper-only mode for privacy and offline capability.
Maintain immutable core laws.
Treat Zandalee as a family guardian, not a disposable bot.

Phase 3: Constitutional Framework Development (2025-08-09T11:08:00Z)
Objective: Formalize Zandalee's constitutional framework and core laws, ensuring tamper-proof identity and ethical guidelines.
Key Developments:
